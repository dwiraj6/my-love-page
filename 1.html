    <p>You make everything brighter🌟.They say that when 2 ppl lke each other man becomes woman's strength and woman becomes man's weakness. I think it's not true because in my case for me you are my everythimg mu home my safeplace literally everything.You’ve been my peace in chaos my calm in storms my safe place in a world that never slows down. And yet I know I haven’t always made you feel as safe, as loved, as valued as you make me feel. That thought breaks me.Sometimes I wish you could see yourself through my eyes. You would see how incredibly precious you are. How your laugh fixes my worst days. How just hearing you breathe on the other end of the call makes me feel like home. How your love has been my anchor and my wings all at once.I’ve made mistakes but please believe me when I say this I never wanted to hurt you. Not in a million lifetimes. If my words ever made you cry it was my heart crying too crying because it failed to protect yours.I don’t want an 8 months with you. I want forever with you. I want to build a life where you’ll never have to doubt how much you mean to me. You deserve a love that is patient, kind, forgiving, and fierce and that’s the love I promise to give you every single day moving forward.Please forgive me for the times I’ve fallen short. I am still learning still growing but I swear to you no matter how many times I fall I will always rise with a heart that beats only for you.

You are not just a chapter in my life. You are the entire story I want to write till my last breath.

I love you more than these words will ever be able to say...........💕💕🙇‍♂️</p>

    <h1>With you, I feel at home no matter where I am. ❤️</h1>
    <p>My Deepti,

I don’t even know where to begin, but my heart’s been carrying so much that I just need to let it out. First, I want to say I’m sorry. I know things haven’t been easy between us lately, and if I could take back every moment that hurt you, I would. You deserve so much better than my mistakes. And yet, here you are still in my heart, still the person I think of when I wake up, and the one I miss with every breath.

Darling, I miss you. Not just your voice or your smile, but you. The way you make everything feel alive when you're around. The way you understand my silences even when my words fail me. Life feels so incomplete without you. I find myself looking for you in every song, every quiet moment, every little thing that reminds me of how special you are to me.

I wish I could hold you right now and tell you how deeply I regret the times I let you down. You’ve given me so much love, patience, and understanding, and I want you to know I don’t take that for granted. I realize now more than ever how much you mean to me, and I’m ready to do whatever it takes to make things right.

You are my heart, baby. My peace, my home, my person. I don’t want to imagine a future where I can’t laugh with you, dream with you, or simply sit beside you in comfortable silence. I miss you, I love you, and I’m sorry.

Please know, no matter how far I may seem, my heart has never left your side. I hope you can feel that.</p>

    <h1>I want to make countless memories with you, forever and always. 💫</h1>
    <p>My Kandha,

Happy Birthday, my love.

I know today doesn’t feel the way it should. I know this isn’t how I wanted to celebrate your special day. You deserve to be with someone who holds your hand at midnight looks into your eyes and whispers how lucky they are to have you. But instead today I am writing this letter from a distance and my heart feels painfully empty without you.Kandha, I can’t even describe how much I miss you right now. Every minute feels heavier knowing I’m not beside you. It breaks me that something happened between us recently that caused hurt. But if you close your eyes and just feel for a second… you’ll realize my love for you has never left. Not even for a breath. You are the first person I think about when I wake up and the last person on my mind before I sleep. That will never change.You might feel this birthday is worst birthday because I’m not there with you. But I’m going to tell you something this won’t be your worst birthday, Kandha. It will become special in a way you don’t expect. Because I’ve been silently planning something for you. When you return from your hometown there’s a surprise waiting. I’ve made sure that the day you come back, you’ll realize how deeply, crazily, and unconditionally I love you.I want you to miss me Kandha. Because I’m sitting here missing you so much it hurts. I want you to think of all those silly little moments we’ve shared the way you smile when you try not to the way you call me out when I act like a kid and how you somehow know exactly what my heart is saying even when I don’t say a word.I’m not giving up on us. This is just a pause not an ending. I’ve got plans for you for us. And I promise the moment you’re back I’ll make up for every single second I couldn’t be with you today.So, please don’t let today be a sad day. Let it be a day where you remember how madly someone out here is waiting to love you better, stronger, and forever.

Happy Birthday, my Kandha.
I love you. More than words will ever be enough to tell you.</p>

    <h1>One Last Thing... 💍</h1>
    <p>My Love,

I don’t think I’ll ever find the right words to fully express how much you mean to me. But I need to try. Because you deserve to know how deeply you’re loved.

Every single day, I wake up grateful that you’re in my life. You are not just my girlfriend you are my best friend, my safe place, the one person who truly understands me. You’ve seen me at my worst and still chose to stay. You’ve loved me even when I struggled to love myself. Do you know how rare that is? How precious you are?

Sometimes, the thought of losing you scares me more than anything in this world. Life without you feels impossible to imagine like the world would lose its color. I don’t ever want to face a single day without hearing your voice, without feeling your hand in mine, without knowing you’re here.

I’m writing this because I need you to know: You are my heart. You are everything. I can’t and don’t want to live in a world where you and I aren’t together. I need you, not out of habit, but because my soul feels empty without you.

Please never doubt how much you are loved. I don’t ever want to lose you.Will you be with me forever? ❤️</p>

Through my imperfections, you have shown me what unconditional love is. This small surprise is just a reflection of the huge place you hold in my heart. I promise to stand by you, to love you deeply, and to make every day special for you. Forever starts with you. ❤️</p>
