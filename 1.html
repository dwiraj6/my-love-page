    <p>I know I’ve made mistakes. I'm sorry for my behaviour. There were many things which were wrong. I could have stopped them, but I didn’t. I genuinely ask for your forgiveness. I never intended to hurt you. I'm so, so, so, so, so, really very sorry. I know I’ve made mistakes, but my love for you has always been pure ❤️. If possible, please forgive me. I won’t repeat them again.</p>

    <h1>For my best Part of my life......</h1>
    <p>You make everything brighter🌟. They say when two people love each other, man becomes woman’s strength and woman becomes man’s weakness. I don’t believe that. Because in my case, you are my everything—my home, my safe place. You’ve been my peace in chaos, my calm in storms, my anchor and my wings. I haven’t always made you feel the love you deserve, and that hurts me more than anything. I wish you could see yourself through my eyes. You’d see how precious, beautiful, and irreplaceable you are. I don’t want 8 months with you. I want forever. I’m learning, growing, and becoming someone who’s worthy of your love. Please forgive me. You are my entire story. I love you more than these words could ever say. 💕💕🙇‍♂️</p>

    <h1>With you, I feel at home no matter where I am. ❤️</h1>
    <p>My Deepti,<br><br>I don’t even know where to begin, but my heart’s been carrying so much. First, I want to say I’m sorry. If I could take back every moment that hurt you, I would. You deserve so much better than my mistakes. And yet, you are still in my heart, still the one I think of when I wake up. Darling, I miss you. Not just your voice or your smile—but the way you make everything feel alive. Life feels incomplete without you. I wish I could hold you right now and tell you how deeply I regret letting you down. You are my peace, my home, my person. Please know: my heart has never left your side. I hope you can feel that.</p>

    <p>My Kandha,<br><br>Happy Birthday, my love.<br><br>I know today doesn’t feel the way it should. I wanted to be there, hold your hand, whisper how lucky I am to have you. But today, I’m writing this from a distance, and my heart feels empty. Still, if you close your eyes, you’ll feel it—my love. It’s always with you. Every song, every moment, reminds me of you. I’ve planned a surprise for when you're back. Please don’t let today feel like your worst birthday. Let it be the day you realize someone out here is waiting to love you better, stronger, and forever.<br><br>Happy Birthday, my Kandha. I love you.</p>

You are not just my girlfriend—you are my best friend, my safe place, the one person who truly understands me. You’ve loved me even when I struggled to love myself. Do you know how rare and precious that is?<br><br>Sometimes, the thought of losing you scares me more than anything. Life without you feels impossible—like the world would lose its color.
